# Decentralized Commerce Platform
This is the intial test for the smart contracts for a decentralized e-commerce platform

# Truffle
All the smart contracts, migrations, test scripts, and ABI's are located in the "truffle" folder

To start up the front end you can run ```svelte-kit dev```
The truffle VS Code extension is pretty helpful from testing, compiling and migrating contracts
Run ```truffle test``` to test all contracts ```truffle compile``` to compile all contracts and ```truffle migrate``` to deploy all contracts to you local Ganache instance
